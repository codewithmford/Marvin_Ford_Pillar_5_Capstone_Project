        "This step evaluates the recommender system beyond accuracy by examining explainability, ethical considerations, and bias risks. Because the solution is a content-based recommender with no user profiles or prediction labels, traditional supervised explainability and fairness techniques are not directly applicable. Instead, this step applies recommender-appropriate methods to explain why recommendations are generated, audit content exposure bias, document mitigation strategies, and transparently disclose system limitations. The goal is to ensure the system is interpretable, auditable, and responsible under real-world, data-limited conditions."

        "\n",
        "Explainability results show that recommendations are driven by clear, interpretable content signals. Term overlap analysis highlights shared high-importance words (e.g., “father,” “life,” “death,” “documentaries”), directly explaining why titles are matched. This provides a transparent, recommender-appropriate alternative to SHAP or LIME. Feature contribution analysis confirms a balanced weighting between genre (0.40) and description (0.60), supporting interpretability and business alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias auditing identifies exposure differences between the catalog and recommendations, with some genres and countries receiving higher recommendation shares (e.g., U.S. ≈ 0.50 in recommendations vs ≈ 0.25 in the catalog). These patterns justify the use of Intra-list Diversity (ILD), balanced feature weighting, and coverage-aware selection as built-in mitigation strategies. Since no user data or prediction outcomes exist, fairness is assessed through content exposure and diversity rather than demographic metrics. Overall, the results demonstrate transparent, auditable, and responsibly controlled recommendation behavior under data-limited conditions.\n",
