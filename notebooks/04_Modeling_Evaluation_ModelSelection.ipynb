        "This step evaluates multiple content-based similarity approaches to determine which method best supports relevant, diverse, and explainable recommendations at scale. By comparing rule-based heuristics, TF-IDF representations, weighted hybrid models, and semantic embeddings under a consistent cosine similarity framework, this step surfaces practical trade-offs between relevance, diversity, and catalog exposure. The goal is not to maximize a single metric, but to identify a balanced solution that performs reliably in cold-start and data-limited environments.\n",

        "Models were evaluated progressively, starting with a rules-based baseline for full explainability, then TF-IDF to capture term relevance, followed by a weighted hybrid model to explicitly control the relevance–diversity trade-off, and finally semantic embeddings to capture deeper contextual similarity. Rules-based and heavily weighted TF-IDF models achieve perfect Precision@K but show very low Intra-list Diversity, indicating repetitive recommendations. Standard TF-IDF improves diversity but weakens relevance stability, while tuning confirms that excessive genre weighting narrows recommendations. Hyperparameter tuning was applied only to Model 2 because it uniquely exposes an interpretable control parameter; other models are fixed or pretrained. Overall, the embedding-based model provides the best balance, achieving high relevance (Precision@K = 0.96), stronger diversity (ILD = 0.34), and stable catalog exposure.\n",
