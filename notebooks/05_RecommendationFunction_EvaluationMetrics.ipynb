        "\n",
        "The evaluation shows that the final recommender produces thematically relevant and context-aware recommendations across diverse anchor titles. Intra-list Diversity adapts appropriately to content specificity, ranging from 0.20 for narrow family titles to 0.78 for broader crime and drama content, while documentaries exhibit moderate diversity (ILD 0.38–0.71). Catalog Coverage remains consistently low at 0.001 (≈ 0.1% per Top-10 list), reflecting an expected precision-focused retrieval strategy. Low metric variance (ILD variance 0.056; CC ≈ 0.000) confirms stable and predictable behavior across multiple anchors, supporting the model’s robustness and suitability for deployment under data-limited conditions.\n",

        "*   **Qualitative Relevance**:\n",
        "    *  Example titles (e.g., Dick Johnson Is Dead, Ghost Rider, Show Dogs) retrieve genre- and theme-consistent recommendations, validating semantic similarity behavior\n",

        "    *  Ranges from **0.20** (Show Dogs, niche family genre) to **0.78** (King of Boys: The Return of the King, broader crime/drama mix)\n",
        "    *  Documentary and politically themed titles show moderate diversity (ILD **0.38–0.71**)\n",
        "    *  **Variance: 0.056, Std. Dev.: 0.237**, indicating stable diversity behavior across anchors\n",
