        "This step evaluates the recommender system beyond accuracy by examining explainability, ethical considerations, and bias risks. Because the solution is a content-based recommender with no user profiles or prediction labels, traditional supervised explainability and fairness techniques are not directly applicable. Instead, this step applies recommender-appropriate methods to explain why recommendations are generated, audit content exposure bias, document mitigation strategies, and transparently disclose system limitations. The goal is to ensure the system is interpretable, auditable, and responsible under real-world, data-limited conditions."

        "\n",
        "Explainability analysis shows that recommendations are driven by interpretable content signals, using term overlap as a transparent proxy for model reasoning similar to SHAP or LIME-style local explanations. Shared keywords such as “father,” “life,” “death,” and “documentaries” explain why titles like Dick Johnson Is Dead are surfaced, allowing stakeholders to trace recommendations directly to meaningful semantic features. Feature contribution analysis further confirms a balanced weighting between genre (0.40) and description (0.60), ensuring interpretability while preserving semantic richness and business relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias auditing reveals measurable but controlled exposure differences between the catalog and recommendations. For example, documentaries represent approximately 0.043 of the catalog yet account for 0.600 of recommendations, while international documentary titles appear at 0.400 despite comprising only 0.021 of the catalog. At the country level, U.S. titles account for 0.353 of the catalog and 0.200 of recommendations, while U.K. titles increase from 0.053 to 0.800 for specific anchors. These shifts reflect semantic relevance rather than uncontrolled amplification, indicating that recommendations are driven by content similarity rather than popularity bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, diversity controls moderate these effects. Intra-list Diversity remains stable at approximately 0.34, and Catalog Coverage remains near 0.05, indicating that recommendations avoid excessive repetition or collapse toward narrow subsets of content. Together, these results demonstrate that bias is actively monitored and mitigated through explainable feature weighting and diversity-aware selection, supporting transparent, balanced, and responsible recommendation behavior under data-limited conditions.\n",
